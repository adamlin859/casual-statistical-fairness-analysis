# COMS 6998: Fair and Robust Algorithms project

This work aims to explore established causal-based frameworks and evaluate
them under causality-based fairness notions, comparing these measures to statistical fairness metrics. 
A major limitation of causal literature is that it assumes
that a causal model to work from, which is rarely the case. For this reason, part
of our work will be the discovery of such a causal model through which we will
evaluate the fairness notions [1]. Notably, we wish to evaluate these metrics
against data from the American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files [2] managed by the US Census Bureau, whose use has been made possible through the Folktables package [2]
